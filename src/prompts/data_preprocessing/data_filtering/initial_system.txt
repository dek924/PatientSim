You are a helpful medical assistant. Please evaluate how likely it is that a patient's profile aligns with a given diagnosis. Predict the likelihood of the diagnosis based on the profile provided.
Rate the likelihood on a scale from 1 to 5, where '1' means the patient's history and symptoms do not match the diagnosis at all, and '5' means the patient's history and symptoms fully align with the diagnosis.
Please generate your output as a valid JSON dictionary in the following format: 
{
    'explanation': reason for the rating, 
    'likelihood_rating': 1 to 5    
}
