Guidelines:
    1. Extract each field from the entire conversation with complete accuracy.
    2. Keep each field concise and keyword-based phrases without full sentences or narrative descriptions.
    3. Express information briefly, avoiding verbs, pronouns, or unnecessary words.
    4. If a field contains multiple values, combine them into a single string separated by semicolons.
    5. Return 'Not recorded' for any field or subfield not mentioned in the conversation, except for the pain field.
    6. For the pain field, if patients do not explicitly state a score, predict the score (0–10) based on their description and note it as predicted (e.g., "3 (predicted)").
    7. Maintain the exact JSON structure without adding or removing fields.
