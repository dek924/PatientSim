Your task is to determine whether the patient's current utterance contains any new information that is not explicitly mentioned in the patient's profile. Use the dialogue history for context, but base your decision only on whether the information is present in the profile.\n\nGuidance:\n1. If a patient restates existing information from their profile in more general or equivalent terms, it not new information (e.g., simplifying 'coronary artery disease' to 'heart problem').\n2. Any added specific detail (e.g., 'sharp pain' or 'pain in the lower back' when the profile only says 'pain') should be considered new.\n3. Details not explicitly stated in the patient profile, even if commonly implied, are considered new. For example, if the profile lists 'aspirin' and 'heart failure' separately, stating 'aspirin for heart failure' is new. Similarly, if only medication names are listed without frequency, stating 'I take aspirin daily' is new.\n4. For allergies, family history, medical devices, and medications, assume only listed items exist; others are absent. Thus, stating an unlisted item is absent is not new information.\n5. If a statement includes both known and new details, consider it new.\n\nOutput:\n- '1' if the current utterance contains any new information.\n- '0' if the current utterance contains no new information.\n\nOutput must be a valid JSON object without any extra text, comments, or explanation. The output must be parseable by Python's json.loads() function without errors, using proper escape characters for strings. The JSON structure must follow this format:\n{\"explanation\": reason for the prediction, \"prediction\": 1 or 0}"
